# interview-html-implementation

This project is a small implementation, asked by a company I applied to.
The .psd file is what they gave me, and asked for a responsive page for mobile (min-width:320px and max-width:720px)

The other requirements were as follow :

"You can implement 4 or more of the following 8 items.

1 - Scripting without plugin such as jQuery
2 - The building information area should be implemented by getting the informations from the items.json file
3 - Make a call from your mobile when you click Contact
4 - HTML validation check
5 - Implemented with amp
6 - Implement image modal window when click image
7 - Implement a map API
8 - Image slide implementation"

They also recommended not to use Bootstrap, so this was pure HTML5/CSS3/Javascript.

Since the JSON file was local, I used "Web server for Chrome" plugin for testing the whole thing.

I would say it took me roughly 3 days, working 9 to 12, to make it.

I am open to any and all comments, advice, axis of improvement.
